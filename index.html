							<h3>LIFE OF A PENGUINE: BABY</h3>
							<p>Baby penguins are tiny, fluffy, and incredibly adorable creatures that begin their life in some of the most challenging environments on Earth. They are born after a long incubation period in which one or both parents keep the egg warm and safe. The early life of a penguin chick is marked by significant growth and change, including molting their down feathers and learning to recognize their parents' calls amidst the cacophony of the colony. Despite the harsh conditions of their habitats, baby penguins are nurtured and protected by their parents, providing them a
								strong start in life.</p>

							<h3>LIFE OF A PENGUINE: ADULT</h3>

							<p class="intro">Adulthood in penguins is a testament to their resilience and adaptability. It is during this phase that penguins become active participants in the preservation of their species through breeding. As fully mature creatures, they face the realities of the harsh Antarctic environment, using the skills they honed as juveniles, all while contributing to the delicate balance of their ecosystem.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>SEX</h3>
							<p>Adult penguins display unwavering commitment to their offspring through courtship, nest building, and incubating eggs during the breeding season.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>MASTERCHEFS</h3>
							<p>Adult penguins utilize their perfected hunting skills to dive into the deep sea, seeking out krill, fish, and squid as a vital source of sustenance for themselves and their offspring.</p>

							<h3>LIFE OF A PENGUINE: OLD</h3>


							<p class="intro">The journey of penguins into old age is a story of perseverance and survival, displaying their inherent hardiness in the unforgiving polar environment. Although the life expectancy of penguins can vary depending on the species, most individuals entering old age exhibit signs of slowing down, reflecting the rigors of a lifetime spent in some of the planet's harshest conditions. Still, they continue to contribute to the balance and dynamism of their ecosystem.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>Retirement</h3>
							<p>Penguins can live up to 30 years in the wild, overcoming numerous challenges to reach old age.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>NICK CANNON</h3>
							<p>Some old penguins continue to breed well into their later years. However, their breeding success tends to decline due to their decreasing physical capabilities.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>FIRST KNEECAP</h3>
							<p>Aging penguins adapt to their physical limitations with their accumulated knowledge and instincts, navigating the challenges of old age.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>NO ASSISTED LIVING</h3>
							<p>Old penguins contribute to the social structure of their colony, participating in collective behaviors such as huddling for warmth.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>CONSULTANTS</h3>
							<p>Older penguins potentially play a role in passing on vital survival information to younger generations, contributing to the preservation of species traditions and instincts.</p>

							<h3>DEATH OF A PENGUIN</h3>

							<p class="intro">The inevitability of death is a part of every life cycle in the animal kingdom, and penguins are no exception. The passing of these charismatic birds marks the end of a life spent braving the frigid, harsh, and oftentimes, dangerous conditions of their polar habitats. Yet, their death contributes to the cycle of life in these ecosystems, providing sustenance for other organisms and nutrients for the environment.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>TOO MANY KIDS</h3>
							<p>Once penguins have reached the end of their reproductive age, their survival rates tend to decline. This is often due to physical exhaustion and the natural weakening of their body systems, making them more susceptible to illness and predation.

								This highlights the strenuous effort and physical toll that breeding and raising chicks takes on penguins. After years of enduring these repetitive cycles, it is not uncommon for penguins to experience significant physical deterioration, leading to a higher mortality rate.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>SURVIVAL FOR THE FITTEST</h3>
							<p>While penguins face the threat of predation throughout their lives, the sick or old are especially vulnerable. Their predators, such as seals, sharks, and orcas, play a crucial role in maintaining balance within the ecosystem.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>covid-19</h3>
							<p>Disease can also be a cause of death for penguins. Illnesses can spread rapidly within a densely populated colony, particularly under conditions of environmental stress.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
							<p>Changes in sea-ice conditions and food availability, often linked to climate change, can lead to starvation, particularly among chicks and juveniles, but also among adults during harsh conditions.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="vertical__item">
							<h3>RECYCLED</h3>
							<p>Upon death, the bodies of penguins return nutrients to the environment, serving as a food source for scavengers and contributing to the nutrient cycle within their ecosystems. Their lives, thus, are intrinsically woven into the fabric of their habitats, influencing the environment even in death.</p>
